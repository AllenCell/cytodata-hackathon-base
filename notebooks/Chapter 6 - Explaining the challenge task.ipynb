    "- Link to integrated mitotic cell on allencell.org\n",
    "- Explain how we do the train, test, validation, split (perhaps this should be a column in the manifest, or that can be pulled into the manifest)\n",

    "- Explaining the task\n",
    "- Can you build a more advanced classifier, one with the lowest possible error on the test set?\n",
    "- Are there mislabeled cells in the dataset, i.e. those that are systematically mispredicted?\n",
    "- Which features (metrics and image channels) boost classification performance?\n",
    "- Does it help to use 3D images vs 2D images?\n",
    "- Can you report on biological observations / insights based on this task?\n",
