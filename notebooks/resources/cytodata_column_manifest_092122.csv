cell_stage,"a label indicating the cell cycle stage of this cell, which could be ""M0"", ""M1M2"", ""M3"", ""M4M5"", “M6M7_single” or ""M6M7_complete"".

Here, M6M7_single vs M6M7_complete indicate whether the two daugher cells are both included in this cell. These labels were generated by the combination of rule-based criteria and a deep learning based classifier.
