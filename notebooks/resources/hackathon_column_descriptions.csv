cell_stage,"a label indicating the cell cycle stage of this cell, which could be ""M0"", ""M1M2"", ""M3"", ""M4M5"", “M6M7_single” or ""M6M7_complete"". See more details about M0, M1, …, M7 at https://www.allencell.org/hips-cells-during-mitosis.html. Here, M6M7_single vs M6M7_complete indicate whether the two daugher cells are both included in this cell. These labels were generated by the combination of rule-based criteria and a deep learning based classifier. See more details and the training data used to build the deep learning based classifier here: https://open.quiltdata.com/b/allencell/packages/aics/mitotic_annotation.",cell metadata
