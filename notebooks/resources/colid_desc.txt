col_id	description
CellId	a unique identifier of each cell (match with the CellId in cfe.allencell.org)
gene	the fluorescently tagged gene that represents the cell line this image was acquired from
this_cell_nbr_complete	a boolean value indicating if all the direct neighboring cells in the colony are successfully segmented and included in the dataset
this_cell_nbr_dist_2d	a dictionary of the distance (2D euclidean distance in XY dimension) from this cell to its neightbors in the dataset.
scale_micron	the size (in micrometer) of a single voxel along each dimension
edge_flag	a boolean value indicating if this cell is on the edge of a colony
FOVId	a unique identifier of the FOV image this cell is segmented from
this_cell_index	the index of this cell (i.e., the integer value in the segmentation image) in this FOV.
PlateId	Plate identifier
WellId	Well identifier
cell_stage	a label indicating the cell cycle stage of this cell, which could be "M0", "M1M2", "M3", "M4M5", “M6M7_single” or "M6M7_complete". See more details about M0, M1, …, M7 at https://www.allencell.org/hips-cells-during-mitosis.html. Here, M6M7_single vs M6M7_complete indicate whether the two daugher cells are both included in this cell. These labels were generated by the combination of rule-based criteria and a deep learning based classifier. See more details and the training data used to build the deep learning based classifier here: https://open.quiltdata.com/b/allencell/packages/aics/mitotic_annotation.
