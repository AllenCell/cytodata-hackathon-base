    "The original hiPSC Single-Cell Image dataset consists of **215,081** single-cell images which were extracted from **18,100** fields of view (FOVs) of our cell colonies. Segmentations were computed at the FOV level using the Allen Cell and Structure Segmenter (Chen et al., 2018), with code and trained models available at https://github.com/AllenCell/segmenter_model_zoo. Single cells were extracted from the FOVs using the cell segmentation results. All images were rescaled to isotropic voxel sizes by interpolating along the z dimension to upscale the voxel size from 0.108333 $\\mu$m x 0.108333 $\\mu$m x 0.29 $\\mu$m  to 0.108333 $\\mu$m x 0.108333 $\\mu$m x 0.108333 $\\mu$m. ROIs were determined by extending the 3D bounding box of the cell by 40 pixels in x and y, and 10 pixels in z. \n",
    "\n",
    "The single-cell images were further processed via a filtering in which outliers were identified based on cell and nuclear metrics e.g. cell surface area and nuclear volume. For our purposes we have removed any cells that were originally identified as an  `outlier` from our processing. The version of the dataset we're working with has outliers removed, resulting in **214,037** single-cell images. The code for this processing is available at https://github.com/AllenCell/cvapipe_analysis/tree/master/cvapipe_analysis/steps/preprocessing.
